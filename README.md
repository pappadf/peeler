# Peeler

**Peeler** is a small C library for unpacking legacy Macintosh compression and archive formats.

Just as you peel an orange to get to the fruit inside, Peeler unpacks old Mac archives to extract their contents — `.sit` (StuffIt), `.cpt` (Compact Pro), `.hqx` (BinHex), and `.bin` (MacBinary) files.

## Formats Supported

- **StuffIt** (`.sit`) — including methods 13, 14, and 15 ("Arsenic")
- **Compact Pro** (`.cpt`)
- **BinHex** (`.hqx`) — 4.0 encoding
- **MacBinary** (`.bin`)

These formats were commonly used for distributing software and documents on classic Macintosh systems before the widespread adoption of `.zip` and other modern formats.

## AI-Generated Library

This library is, to a large degree, **AI-generated**.

The development process involved two stages of AI-assisted work:

1. **Information Gathering & Specification** — AI agents researched these formats from various sources, consolidating scattered documentation into comprehensive, self-contained format specifications (see [`docs/`](docs/)).

2. **Code Generation** — Based on those specifications, other AI agents generated the actual C implementation, test harness, and supporting infrastructure.

The goal was to demonstrate that with careful specification and iteration, AI can produce working implementations of complex, under-documented legacy formats.

## Documentation

Detailed format specifications are available in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory:

- [`sit15.md`](docs/sit15.md) — StuffIt Method 15 ("Arsenic") compression
- [`sit13.md`](docs/sit13.md) — StuffIt Method 13 compression
- [`sit.md`](docs/sit.md) — StuffIt archive structure
- [`cpt.md`](docs/cpt.md) — Compact Pro format
- [`hqx.md`](docs/hqx.md) — BinHex 4.0 encoding
- [`bin.md`](docs/bin.md) — MacBinary format
- [`architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — Library design overview

These specifications were synthesized from scattered resources and are intended to serve as standalone references for anyone implementing decoders for these formats.

## Building

```bash
make
```

This produces the `peeler` executable in the `build/` directory.

## Usage

```bash
./build/peeler <input-file>
```

The tool will automatically detect the format and extract the contents.

## Testing

```bash
cd test
./run_tests.sh
```

The test suite includes 61 test cases covering various StuffIt versions and compression methods, Compact Pro archives, BinHex encodings, and MacBinary wrappers.

## Information Sources

Information about these legacy formats was gathered from numerous sources, including but not limited to:
